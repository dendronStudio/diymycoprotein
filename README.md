Open Source Mycoprotein System, DIY Equipment, Media Recipes

I have been growing edible mushrooms on a home scale for years. 
This project will explore a home or cafe scale growing system for producing mycoprotein 
and creating delicious food with it.

I am starting with a 20L carbouy, aquarium airpump, and plumbing parts typically used for brewing beer.
I have a few cultures and media recipes to test and will post details and results as they come.
Shoot me a message if you have ideas or experience to share.
