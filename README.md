Open Source Mycoprotein System, DIY Equipment, Media Recipes

I have been growing edible mushrooms on a home scale for years. 
This project will explore a home or cafe scale growing system for producing mycoprotein 
and creating delicious food with it.

I am starting with a 2 l mason jar, injectable lid, and a media recipe.
I have a few cultures and media recipes to test and will post details and results as they come.
Shoot me a message if you have ideas or experience to share. 

April 2021 Batch #1

1 liter
10 g mesquite flour
10 g yeast
5 g molasses
5 g table sugar
.005 ml coconut oil (one tiny drop will do)
.5 g epsom salts
.06 g table salt
.5 g gypsum (garden, no additives)

Pressure cooked in 2 liter jar, #15, 15 mins, cool (overnight)
innoculate via injection with 3cc liquid spawn
incubate at 78F(25C), 5 days
heat to 170F for 40 minutes to reduce rna
strain and press to remove excess moisture

I'll let you know what I got soon
